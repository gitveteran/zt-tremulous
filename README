--aimbot--
Aimbot works like this when +button14 is active the aimbot moves aim at 1 degree a snapshot.
If target is >10 derees away the aim moves at 10 degrees a snapshot. Targeting rules out any
thing not in fov, behind walls, or dead; targets that have moved behind walls out of fov are
locked for 1.3 seconds befor the aimbot chooses the next target. Unless you do +newTarg which
forces a new target. for dead targets targeting instantly go to next target. The aimbot will
cutoff small aim updates within ZT_Aimbot_CutOff to lessen jitter.
